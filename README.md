Touch the controls and see the light

This project helps to understand how to work with colors and reactivity at a base level.

## Requirements

- [x] An SVG image (made by yours truly 😉, in [Inkscape][1])
- [x] At least 8 _"bright"_ colors as buttons.
- [x] A _"black"_ button that offs the background and the text shown.

This project also is under [#100DaysOfImba][2] concerns.

## Additional dependencies

Only [Vite][5] as bundler 😁

## What I learned during the process

1. [K.I.S.S. Principle][3]
2. Tailwind-link colors from [Imba][4] 💚
3. How to apply some SVG effects in [Inkscape][1]
